I don't remember when music stopped being enough.

At some point—maybe when Spotify started telling me what I wanted to hear, maybe when every song started sounding like it was written by the same algorithm—I realized I wasn't *listening* anymore. I was just... playing something. Background noise while I did other things. Sonic wallpaper.

<!--more-->

And look, I get it. We're busy. There's a lot going on. The world is loud and exhausting and sometimes you just need something to fill the silence while you answer emails.

But that's not why I fell in love with music.

## The Problem

Here's what happened: the music industry figured out the science. They know exactly how often to repeat the hook. They know the optimal song length for streaming royalties. They know that if they drop the chorus in the first fifteen seconds, you're less likely to skip.

It works. The data proves it.

But here's the thing—you can engineer a craving without ever satisfying it. You can write a song that gets stuck in someone's head without ever touching their heart. You can optimize for attention without ever earning devotion.

And we've all felt it, right? That moment when you realize you've been listening to music for an hour and you can't remember a single song. When your Discover Weekly sounds exactly like last week's. When everything bleeds together into one long, pleasant, utterly forgettable hum.

That's not music. That's content.

## The Idea

So here's what I'm doing about it.

One song. Every day. With a story.

Not whatever the algorithm thinks I want. Not what's trending on TikTok. Just songs that actually *mean* something—to me, to the people who made them, to the moment in history when they appeared.

The '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s mostly. Before the focus groups. When a band could spend three years in a basement getting the guitar tone right. When a songwriter could rewrite the bridge sixteen times because *almost* wasn't good enough.

But not exclusively. Because here's a controversial take: not all pop is bad. Some of the best songs ever written are three minutes of pure, uncut dopamine. The crime isn't accessibility—it's cynicism. There's a difference between writing a song that everyone can love and engineering a product designed to exploit attention spans.

## Why I Actually Care

I was born in the '80s. Raised on whatever my parents left lying around—Fleetwood Mac on, Dire Straits in the DAP player (yeah, before iPods), the Eagles on every road trip whether I wanted them or not. Music was always on.

By the time I was old enough to choose my own music, grunge was dying and I was backfilling decades like a kid who just discovered the library. "Wait, there's *more*? And it's all just... sitting there?"

Music quiets my mind. That's the real reason I'm doing this. When everything else is too loud—the news, the notifications, the voice in my head that won't shut up—music is the only thing that works.

Not silence. Silence is just space for the noise to fill.

Music is active silence. Structured calm. Something to follow instead of something to fight.

## The Rules

**One song.** Not a playlist. Not an album deep-dive (usually). Just one song, every day, with enough context to understand why it matters.

**The story matters.** When was it written? What was happening in the world? What was happening to the people who made it? What was happening to me when I first heard it? Music doesn't exist in a vacuum. Neither should writing about it.

**Live versions count.** Sometimes more than the studio recordings. There's something about a song that's been played 300 times on tour—the rough edges worn smooth, the improvisations that became permanent, the moments where the band stops thinking and just *plays*.

**Honesty over reverence.** I can love something and still be a little mean about it. I can call something "eleven kinds of prog-rock pomposity" and still think it's one of the greatest songs ever recorded. Criticism isn't the opposite of love. Indifference is.

**No algorithms.** I'm not optimizing for anything except songs that make me feel something. If that means three U2 songs in a row, so be it. If it means a deep cut nobody's heard of followed by the most overplayed song of 1995, that's fine too.

## What This Is Really About

Look, I'm not trying to save rock and roll or fight the streaming industrial complex or whatever. I'm just trying to remember why I fell in love with this stuff in the first place.

And maybe—if you're reading this—you are too.

Every day, there's a new song. A new story. A reason to actually *listen* instead of just playing something.

That's it. That's the whole idea.

Words + Sound = Everything.

*Everything else is noise.*
