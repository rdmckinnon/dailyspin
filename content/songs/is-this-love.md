## Background

Released in 1978 on Bob Marley's *Kaya* album, "Is This Love" showcases a more tender, romantic side of the reggae legend. Written during a period when Marley was exploring themes of love and unity, the song represents a departure from his more politically charged material while maintaining his signature musical style.

Recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami with The Wailers, the track features the classic reggae rhythm section that made Marley's music so distinctive. The song became one of his most commercially successful singles, reaching audiences far beyond traditional reggae fans.

## Why It's Good

"Is This Love" succeeds through its perfect marriage of vulnerability and confidence. Marley's vocals convey genuine romantic uncertainty while the steady reggae groove provides a foundation of strength and assurance. The interplay between these elements creates a compelling emotional dynamic that resonates with listeners.

The song's genius lies in its universal appeal - the questioning nature of new love is something everyone can relate to, regardless of cultural background. Marley's ability to express deep emotion while maintaining reggae's characteristic laid-back feel creates an irresistible combination.
