"I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings."

That's the whole human condition in nine words. We're all trying to do impossible things without the equipment the universe promised us.

1987. Roger Waters was gone, convinced he'd taken Pink Floyd with him. The lawyers disagreed. So did Gilmour. So did millions of fans who discovered that the spaceship could fly without its most difficult passenger.

*A Momentary Lapse of Reason* wasn't *The Wall*. It wasn't trying to be. This was Gilmour staking a claim, proving that Pink Floyd was bigger than any one ego. "Learning to Fly" was his mission statement: we're still here, we're still reaching, and yes, we can still make you feel something.

The song is about literal flying lessons—Gilmour got his pilot's license and channeled the experience into music. But like all great Floyd tracks, the specific becomes universal. It's not really about planes. It's about the terror and exhilaration of trying something new when failure means falling.

"Coming down is the hardest thing." That line catches me every time. The flight isn't the scary part. Landing is. The return to earth after you've tasted altitude. The inevitable crash that follows every high.

Gilmour's guitar work here is restrained, almost gentle. He's not showing off. He's serving the song, letting the melody breathe, creating space for the lyrics to sink in. The production is clean and warm, atmospheric without being oppressive.

"So I've started out for God knows where. I guess I'll know when I get there."

That's not uncertainty. That's faith. The only kind that matters—faith in the journey when the destination is invisible.

Waters would return eventually. The lawsuits would settle. But this song stands as proof that sometimes the hardest part of learning to fly is deciding to leave the ground at all.

Spread your arms. Jump.

See what happens.
