"Sing us a song, you're the piano man."

Every bar has a Billy Joel. Every bar has a crowd of people who are somewhere they didn't plan to be, drinking against the current of their lives. And every one of them, if you buy them enough drinks, will tell you their story.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - a night at a bar that felt like this, the strangers who became friends for three hours]

1973. Billy Joel was broke, trapped in a bad contract, playing piano under a fake name at a place called the Executive Room in Los Angeles. He was twenty-three years old and already felt like a failure. So he did what writers do: he turned his failure into art.

"Piano Man" is a documentary disguised as a song. John at the bar buying drinks for everyone. Paul, the real estate novelist who never had time for a wife. The waitress practicing politics. Davy, still in the Navy, probably for life. These aren't characters. They were real people. Joel just gave them immortality.

The harmonica intro sets the tone: wistful, working-class, tinged with alcohol and resignation. The waltz tempo swings like someone who's had just enough to loosen up but not enough to fall down. It's the rhythm of a Saturday night that'll feel exactly like last Saturday night and every Saturday night to come.

"And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say, 'Man, what are you doing here?'"

That's the question, isn't it? What are any of us doing here? In this bar, in this town, in this life that looked so different in the brochure?

The genius of the song is that Joel doesn't judge anyone. Not the businessman slowly getting stoned. Not the old man making love to his tonic and gin. Not himself, trapped playing requests for tips. Everyone's just trying to survive. Everyone's looking for a melody to forget.

"And the piano sounds like a carnival, and the microphone smells like a beer."

Those lines smell like a real bar. You can feel the sticky floor, the dim lights, the smoke that used to hang in the air before they banned it. Joel wasn't creating atmosphere—he was transcribing it.

Fifty years later, we're still singing along. Still looking for a place where everybody knows your name, or at least pretends to for the length of a song.

La la la di da da...
