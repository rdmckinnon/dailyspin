The strings come in like fate announcing itself. Not subtle. Not apologetic. Just: here's what's about to happen to your heart.

INXS was an Australian bar band that somehow became one of the biggest acts of the eighties. *Kick* gave them "Need You Tonight" and "New Sensation"—slick, sexy, MTV-ready hits. But "Never Tear Us Apart" is different. It's the moment Michael Hutchence stopped being a frontman and became a force of nature.

They brought in a 60-piece orchestra. Let that sink in. In 1988, when everyone else was drowning in synths and drum machines, INXS hired sixty classical musicians to make a rock song sound like destiny. Producer Chris Thomas understood that what Hutchence was singing required that kind of weight. You can't make promises this big over a drum loop.

"I was standing, you were there." That's the opening line. Simple. Almost nothing. But the way Hutchence delivers it—quiet, reverent, like he's describing a miracle—you know something's coming. He spends the verse barely above a whisper, and then the chorus hits and he's making declarations that could move mountains.

The thing about Hutchence was that he believed it. When he sang about worlds colliding and fate intervening, you could hear that he'd bet everything on love being real. Not love as a concept. Love as a physical force, something that could actually hold two people together against whatever the world threw at them.

He died in 1997. The circumstances were ugly and sad, and they threatened to overshadow everything else. But this song survives all of that. This song is Michael Hutchence at his most alive—vulnerable and certain at the same time, making promises he intended to keep.

Some love songs ask questions. This one makes vows.
