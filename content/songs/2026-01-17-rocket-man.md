"And I think it's gonna be a long, long time."

Bernie Taupin wrote about an astronaut. Elton sang about everyone who ever felt like they were living someone else's life. The space suit was just a costume for the isolation we all carry around.

The song dropped in 1972 on *Honky Château*, recorded in a French castle because of course it was. This was peak Elton—when he could turn anything Bernie handed him into something that made you feel both massive and microscopic at the same time.

"It's just a job five days a week." That line destroys me every time. Not because space travel is boring, but because it reduces the most extraordinary experience imaginable to routine. To commute. The rocket man isn't living the dream. He's showing up for work. He's us.

The production does something remarkable: it makes space feel small. Intimate. The synthesizers create atmosphere, sure, but Elton's piano keeps it grounded. Human. The whole song sounds like it's floating, untethered, which is exactly how isolation feels.

"I'm not the man they think I am at home." There it is. The confession hidden in plain sight. We all have a public version and a private truth. Most of us never get called out on the distance between them. The rocket man does, every time he comes home to a wife who married someone else. Someone who stayed.

Taupin borrowed from Bradbury's short story, but he made it universal. This isn't science fiction. This is Tuesday. This is leaving before the sun comes up and missing your kid's bedtime. This is the cost of ambition disguised as necessity.

The melody climbs and climbs and then just... floats. Suspended. Like the moment before a choice you can't take back. Elton's voice cracks in all the right places, not because he's showing off, but because the song demands it. Some feelings can't survive pristine delivery.

Fifty years later, we're all still burning out our fuses up here alone. The rocket never lands. The distance never shrinks.

That's not tragedy. That's just gravity.
