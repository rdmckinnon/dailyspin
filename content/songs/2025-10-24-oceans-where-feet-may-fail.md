## Background

From Hillsong United's 2013 album *Zion*, "Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)" became one of the most influential worship songs of the decade. Written by Joel Houston, Matt Crocker, and Salomon Ligthelm, the song uses oceanic imagery to explore themes of faith, trust, and stepping into the unknown with God.

The track's success transcended traditional worship music boundaries, reaching mainstream Christian radio and influencing worship styles in churches worldwide. Its contemplative approach marked a shift toward more intimate, reflective worship music.

## Why It's Good

"Oceans" succeeds through its perfect marriage of vulnerability and strength. The sparse arrangement creates space for contemplation, while the gradual build mirrors the song's theme of stepping deeper into faith. Joel Houston's vocals convey both uncertainty and determination, capturing the essence of faithful trust.

The song's genius lies in its oceanic metaphor - the image of walking on water resonates with both biblical narrative and universal human experience of facing the unknown. This layered meaning creates multiple entry points for listeners to connect with the message.

{{< lyrics-callout style="centered" artist="Hillsong United" song="Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)" >}}
You call me out upon the waters  
The great unknown where feet may fail  
And there I find You in the mystery  
In oceans deep  
My faith will stand

The production maintains a sense of vastness and depth that mirrors the ocean imagery, creating an immersive worship experience.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's power lies in its honest exploration of faith in uncertainty and the willingness to trust beyond what we can see.

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders  
Let me walk upon the waters  
Wherever You would call me
