## Background

From The White Stripes' 2003 album *Elephant*, "Seven Nation Army" became one of the most recognizable songs of the 2000s. Written by Jack White, the song's famous bass line was actually played on a guitar with a pitch shifter, creating the deep, hypnotic riff that defines the track. The minimalist approach perfectly exemplified the band's stripped-down aesthetic.

The song's title came from Jack White's childhood mispronunciation of "Salvation Army," and its success helped establish The White Stripes as leaders of the garage rock revival. The track won a Grammy Award and became a stadium anthem worldwide.

## Why It's Good

"Seven Nation Army" succeeds through the power of simplicity and repetition. The iconic riff is both memorable and hypnotic, creating an immediate hook that draws listeners in. Jack White's raw vocals and Meg White's primal drumming create a sense of urgency and power that builds throughout the song.

The song's genius lies in its restraint - rather than adding layers of instrumentation, The White Stripes let the core riff and rhythm drive everything. This minimalist approach creates space for each element to have maximum impact, resulting in a sound that's both primitive and sophisticated.
