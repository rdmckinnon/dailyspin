description: "A mother's advice that took six minutes to say and a lifetime to understand."

"Mama told me when I was young, come sit beside me, my only son."

Everyone has a song their mother should have sung them. This is the one mine did. The one that still calls me back to who I'm supposed to be when I've wandered too far.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - the advice you got that you didn't understand until you needed it]

1973. Lynyrd Skynyrd's debut album with a name nobody could pronounce and songs everybody could feel. Ronnie Van Zant was twenty-four years old, writing like a man who'd already lived several lifetimes. Maybe he knew something. He'd be dead in four years.

"Simple Man" is a mother's monologue set to music. Van Zant and Gary Rossington wrote it as a ballad of guidance, a letter from parent to child, a set of instructions for navigating a world that specializes in complication.

The advice is deceptively simple: forget your lust for rich man's gold. Find a woman who'll love you. Be something you can love and understand. Don't live too fast. Trouble will come, and it will pass.

Try actually doing any of that. I dare you.

The acoustic guitar intro is one of the most recognizable in rock. Soft, deliberate, patient—like a hand on your shoulder before important news. The band builds slowly, knowing the song needs room to breathe, knowing the message won't land if you're rushing to deliver it.

Van Zant's voice on this track is different from the rest of Skynyrd's catalog. Vulnerable. Tender. He's not posturing. He's remembering. He's passing something along that was passed to him.

"And be a simple kind of man. Be something you love and understand."

In a culture obsessed with complexity, with optimization, with more and faster and better—this song is a radical act of resistance. It suggests that enough might actually be enough. That wanting less might mean having more.

I don't always believe it. But I always need to hear it.

Thanks, Mama. Thanks, Ronnie.

Some lessons take a while to sink in.
