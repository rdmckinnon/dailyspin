There's a warehouse in Charlottesville, Virginia, where five guys used to practice before anyone knew their names. The light came through the windows a certain way. Dust hung in the air. They played until they couldn't feel their fingers, and then they played some more. Eventually, they left. And Dave Matthews wrote a song asking: what remains?

This is the track that separates the DMB tourists from the lifers. "Crash" and "Ants Marching" are the hits—college parties, summer cookouts, that whole vibe. But "Warehouse" is where Matthews stops being a guy with an acoustic guitar and starts being a philosopher disguised as a jam band frontman.

Seven minutes on the album. In concert, it stretches to fifteen, twenty, sometimes longer. LeRoi Moore's saxophone spiraling into places saxophones aren't supposed to go. Boyd Tinsley's violin screaming and weeping. The whole band locked into something that sounds less like a performance and more like a séance.

What he's asking is simple: when we leave a place, what's left of us? The echo of conversations. The wear patterns on the floor. The light that still comes through the same windows it always did, even when we're not there to see it. Every building we've ever inhabited holds some ghost of who we were inside it.

"Life and death are things you breathe," Matthews sings, which is the kind of line that sounds like stoned nonsense until you realize he's right. Every breath is both. Every moment is passing while it's happening.

The thing about jam bands is that they're usually about the journey, not the destination. But "Warehouse" has a destination. It lands somewhere. By the end, you're not just listening to a song—you're sitting in whatever space you're in, wondering what trace of yourself will remain when you're gone.

Some songs are about places. This one's about haunting them.
