## Background

Released in 2013 as part of Pitbull's *Global Warming: Meltdown* album, "Timber" featuring Ke$ha became one of the decade's biggest party anthems. The collaboration brought together Pitbull's club-ready rap style with Ke$ha's rebellious pop energy, creating a track that dominated both radio and dance floors worldwide.

The song was written by a team including Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Priscilla Renea, with production that perfectly captured the EDM-influenced pop sound that defined early 2010s dance music. Its success marked a commercial peak for both artists during the height of the dance-pop era.

## Why It's Good

"Timber" succeeds through its irresistible combination of catchy hooks and dancefloor energy. Pitbull's confident rap verses provide rhythmic momentum, while Ke$ha's powerful vocal delivery on the chorus creates moments of pure euphoria. The interplay between their contrasting styles creates dynamic tension that keeps listeners engaged.

The song's genius lies in its simplicity - it's built around instantly memorable hooks and a driving beat that's impossible to resist. The production incorporates country-influenced elements with modern dance beats, creating a unique sound that appealed to multiple audiences simultaneously.

{{< lyrics-callout style="centered" artist="Pitbull ft. Ke$ha" song="Timber" >}}
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget

The production is polished and radio-ready while maintaining enough edge to satisfy club audiences, striking the perfect balance for mainstream success.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's appeal lies in its celebration of letting loose and embracing the wild side of nightlife culture.

{{< lyrics-callout style="inline" >}}
The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
This biggity boy's a diggity dog  
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off  
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
