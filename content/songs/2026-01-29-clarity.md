There's a moment in your twenties—if you're lucky, maybe more than one—where you realize you've been chasing the wrong thing. The relationship that was supposed to work. The plan that made sense on paper. The version of yourself that everyone expected. And then one morning, for no reason you can explain, the fog lifts.

"Clarity" is from 2003's *Heavier Things*, back when John Mayer was still known primarily for "Your Body Is a Wonderland" and people hadn't figured out yet that he was actually a blues guitar savant disguised as a pop star. This track is the first hint that there was something deeper going on.

The fingerpicking on this thing. Listen to it. Really listen. It's intricate without being showy, every note serving the song's restless, searching mood. Mayer's playing here sounds like someone thinking out loud, working through a problem in real time.

"By the time I recognize this moment, this moment will be gone." That's the whole song right there. That's the whole human condition, really. We're always catching up to our own lives, always a half-beat behind the thing we're trying to understand.

The production is smart—clean and spacious, letting every guitar note breathe. No bombast. No stadium rock moves. Just a guy with a guitar and some questions that don't have easy answers.

What kills me is the line about bending light, pretending it somehow lingered on. We all do that. We all try to stretch the good moments, hold onto them past their natural expiration date. And we all fail. The moment passes whether we're ready or not.

But here's the thing—recognizing that? That's the clarity the song is talking about. Not an answer. Just the honesty to admit you don't have one.

Some songs give you closure. This one gives you permission to not have any.
