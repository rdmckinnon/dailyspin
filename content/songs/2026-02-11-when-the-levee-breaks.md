That drum sound. You've heard it a thousand times and never knew where it came from. Hip-hop producers have sampled it on more tracks than anyone can count. It's the sonic equivalent of a building falling down in slow motion. And it happened because someone put a microphone in a stairwell.

Headley Grange was a drafty old manor house in England where Led Zeppelin set up to record. The rooms had stone floors and high ceilings—terrible for conversation, perfect for capturing the sound of John Bonham hitting things. Producer Jimmy Page suspended microphones from the upper floors of the main stairwell, put Bonham at the bottom, and let physics do the rest.

The original song was a 1929 blues number by Memphis Minnie, about the Great Mississippi Flood that killed hundreds and displaced nearly a million people. Zeppelin took that desperate Delta folk song and turned it into something apocalyptic. Seven minutes of doom, creeping toward you at a tempo that feels like continental drift.

Robert Plant's harmonica is the only thing that acknowledges the song's blues roots. Everything else—Page's guitar spiraling through backwards echoes, John Paul Jones' bass rumbling beneath the earth—sounds like something that evolved past the blues into a different species entirely.

The levee in the song is literal, but it doesn't stay that way. It becomes every breaking point. Every system pushed past its capacity. Every relationship held together by will when the foundation is already crumbling. "Going down now," Plant howls. And you believe him.

This song doesn't build to a climax. It starts at maximum weight and stays there for seven minutes, daring you to hold up under it. Most people can't play it on repeat. It's too heavy. Too relentless.

Some songs rock. This one crushes.
