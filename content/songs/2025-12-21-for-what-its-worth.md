## Background

Written by Stephen Stills in 1966, "For What It's Worth" was inspired by the Sunset Strip curfew riots—clashes between police and young people protesting the closure of clubs and strict curfew enforcement. Though born from a specific local incident, the song's lyrics proved universal enough to become the anthem of broader 1960s unrest.

Buffalo Springfield, featuring Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay, created something that transcended its origin. The song reached number seven on the Billboard chart and has since soundtracked every era's civil tensions.

## Why It's Good

"For What It's Worth" succeeds through its restraint. Where other protest songs shout, this one observes with eerie calm. Stills' vocal delivery is almost conversational, making the content more unsettling. The famous guitar riff—simple, repetitive, hypnotic—creates tension without resolution.

The song's genius lies in its vagueness. By avoiding specific grievances, it applies to any situation where authority and youth clash. The paranoia in lines about people carrying signs and battle lines being drawn resonates across decades.

The production maintains an atmosphere of watchful unease. The band never explodes into cathartic release—the tension just continues, unresolved, like the conflicts it describes.

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics observe without judging, documenting a society fracturing. Stills captures the confusion and fear on both sides—young people wondering what's happening, authorities overreacting, everyone uncertain.

The famous opening line about something happening here has introduced countless documentaries and news reports, its vagueness making it eternally applicable.
