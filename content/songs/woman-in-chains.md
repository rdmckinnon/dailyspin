## Background

Released in 1989 as part of *The Seeds of Love*, "Woman in Chains" marked a creative peak for Tears for Fears and introduced the world to the extraordinary Oleta Adams. Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith discovered Adams performing in a Kansas City hotel bar and were so impressed they invited her to collaborate on their ambitious third album.

The song was written by Orzabal as a meditation on various forms of oppression - emotional, societal, and personal. The title itself can be interpreted multiple ways: the chains that bind women in relationships, society, or even the chains we create for ourselves. This ambiguity gives the song its lasting power and relevance.

## Why It's Good

"Woman in Chains" succeeds on every level - songwriting, performance, and production. Orzabal's composition builds from intimate verses to a soaring, gospel-influenced chorus that showcases both his and Adams' vocal abilities. The interplay between their voices creates a dialogue that feels both conversational and operatic.

The production, helmed by Dave Bascombe, layers piano, strings, and subtle electronic elements to create a sound that's both contemporary and timeless. The arrangement gives space for the vocals to breathe while providing emotional support through carefully placed instrumental flourishes.

Adams' vocal performance is particularly stunning - her gospel and R&B background brings an authenticity and power that elevates the entire track. When she enters the song, it transforms from introspective to transcendent.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's emotional core lies in its exploration of the various chains that bind us, both visible and invisible.

The duet format allows for different perspectives on the same struggle, creating a rich dialogue about liberation and self-discovery.
