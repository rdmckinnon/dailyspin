You know that bass line. You know it before you even remember where it comes from. It lives somewhere in the reptile brain, right next to fight-or-flight and the smell of rain on hot pavement. John McVie wrote the only four notes that matter.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - when/where did this song find you?]

Here's the thing about "The Chain"—it's the only song on *Rumours* credited to all five members of Fleetwood Mac. Not because they sat around a campfire harmonizing about collaboration. Because they stitched it together from the wreckage of three different songs, none of which were working on their own. Frankenstein's monster, held together with cocaine and spite and the knowledge that if they didn't finish this album, everyone was broke.

Stevie and Lindsey had just imploded. John and Christine were done. And somehow, in the middle of that emotional apocalypse, they made an album about it. They made *this* song about it.

The track opens soft—almost gentle, really. Lindsey's guitar and Stevie's voice doing that interweaving thing that only works when two people know each other too well. You could almost convince yourself it's going to be a ballad. And then the drums start that military march, and you realize something's coming. Something inevitable.

"Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise." Simple words. But the way they deliver them, you can hear people who are genuinely asking each other to pay attention. To not look away. To acknowledge what's happening even as everything falls apart.

And then that bass line drops, and the whole thing transforms. It's not a love song anymore. It's a war cry. It's a promise and a threat wrapped in the same breath: *you will never break the chain*.

The chains they're talking about? The band. The music. The thing that was bigger than any of their personal disasters. The thing that kept them in the same room when every rational instinct said to run.

That's the deal they made. Not with each other—with the work itself.

Some songs are about love. This one's about survival.
