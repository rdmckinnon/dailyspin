## Background

Originally from Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera *The Wall*, "Mother" examines the suffocating love of an overprotective parent. This version, from Roger Waters' massive 1990 Berlin concert celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall, features Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor in the mother's role, creating a devastating dialogue.

O'Connor's casting proved inspired. Her crystalline voice and emotional intensity brought new dimensions to the mother character—her gentleness making the control even more disturbing. The performance became one of the concert's emotional peaks.

## Why It's Good

This live "Mother" succeeds through the chemistry between Waters and O'Connor. The song's dialogue structure—child asking questions, mother providing false reassurance—becomes genuinely dramatic when performed by two distinct voices. O'Connor's sweetness makes her promises of protection sound tender and terrifying simultaneously.

The song's genius lies in its portrayal of love as weapon. The mother genuinely believes she's protecting her child, making her control more insidious than obvious cruelty would be. Every reassurance builds another brick in the wall.

The Berlin performance adds historical resonance. A song about walls—psychological and physical—performed where the most famous wall had just fallen gains additional meaning.

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics present a mother-son dialogue where each exchange reveals the damage being done. The mother's promises to check all girlfriends and keep the child from harm read as love letters written in chains.

Waters' questions grow increasingly desperate while the mother's answers remain steadily, horrifyingly calm.
