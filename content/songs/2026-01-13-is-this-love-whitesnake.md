Here's the thing about power ballads: most of them are lies. Calculated studio creations designed to get lighters in the air and phones to dial-in requests. "Is This Love" should be one of those. It has all the ingredients—the soaring chorus, the guitar solo, the key change. But something's different.

David Coverdale built Whitesnake into one of the biggest hair metal bands of the eighties. "Here I Go Again." "Still of the Night." Songs about swagger and sex and staying out all night. The whole image was leather pants and teased hair and never admitting you felt anything softer than lust.

But then he wrote this. And instead of telling us how he felt, he asked a question.

"Is this love that I'm feeling?" That's not a rhetorical flourish. That's a grown man in a room full of guitars admitting he doesn't know what's happening to him. The question mark is everything. It turns a power ballad into a confession.

John Sykes' guitar work on this track is the sound of trying to figure something out. Those melodic runs in the chorus—they're searching, not arriving. Even when the song builds to stadium-rock enormity, there's still uncertainty underneath. The question never gets answered.

1987 was peak hair metal. Bands were competing to be the loudest, the fastest, the most excessive. And Whitesnake released a song about being confused by their own feelings. It went to number two.

Turns out, even people wearing leather in the eighties wanted permission to be vulnerable. They just needed it packaged in a way they could slow-dance to.

Some love songs know all the answers. This one earns its keep by being brave enough to ask.
