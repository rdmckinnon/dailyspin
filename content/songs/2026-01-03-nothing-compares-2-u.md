## Background

From Chris Cornell's 2007 solo album *Carry On*, this acoustic interpretation of Prince's 1985 composition (made famous by Sinéad O'Connor in 1990) strips away all production to leave just Cornell's voice and guitar. The Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman brought his signature emotional intensity to a song already known for vulnerability.

Cornell's version emerged during a solo period between his iconic bands, showcasing his range beyond grunge's roar. His choice to cover Prince demonstrated both confidence and impeccable taste.

## Why It's Good

Cornell's "Nothing Compares 2 U" succeeds through devastating simplicity. Where other versions have production to hide behind, this one exposes every crack in his voice, every hesitation and rasp. His four-octave range serves the song's emotional peaks without showboating.

The song's genius lies in Cornell's commitment to the lyric's pain. He doesn't interpret the song as a rock singer covering pop—he inhabits the heartbreak completely. When his voice strains, it's because the emotion demands it.

The stripped arrangement creates intimacy impossible in fuller productions. Just voice and acoustic guitar, the most exposed musical context, carrying extraordinary emotional weight.

## Standout Lyrics

Prince's lyrics chronicle post-breakup desolation—the narrator trying and failing to replace what was lost. Every attempted comfort fails; nothing compares.

Cornell's delivery makes familiar lines feel newly discovered, his voice conveying both the specific pain of loss and its universal recognition.
