That opening synth line. You know exactly what's coming, and you still can't prepare for it.

Townshend programmed those arpeggios to mimic his heartbeat. Then he handed it to Keith Moon, Roger Daltrey, and John Entwistle, and they turned a meditation into a detonation.

1971. *Who's Next*. The remains of a failed rock opera called *Lifehouse* that was too ambitious even for Townshend's galaxy-sized ego. But from the wreckage came this—five minutes of the future arriving early.

The name is a mashup: Meher Baba, Townshend's spiritual guru, and Terry Riley, the minimalist composer whose repetitive patterns inspired the song's hypnotic foundation. Two very different influences creating something neither could have imagined alone.

"Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals." Daltrey howls it like he means every word, like he's actually been hungry, like the agricultural revolution personally wronged him. The Who could make anything feel urgent. A song about teenage boredom becomes a manifesto. A stadium anthem disguised as frustration.

Everyone calls it "Teenage Wasteland." Everyone's wrong. But also kind of right, because that's the part that sticks. The part that feels true. We all remember being young and wasted—wasted time, wasted potential, wasted opportunity. The specific details don't matter. The feeling is universal.

The build is surgical. Synth loop. Then acoustic guitar. Then Daltrey's voice. Then the whole band crashes in like the cavalry. Moon plays like he's fighting the drum kit, and somehow they both survive. The violin at the end—Dave Arbus sawing away as the whole thing collapses into beautiful chaos—was a last-minute addition that became essential.

This is rock music as controlled explosion. Every second calculated to maximize impact. But it never feels clinical because the performance is so raw, so committed, so absolutely convinced of its own necessity.

They don't write them like this anymore.

They probably couldn't.
