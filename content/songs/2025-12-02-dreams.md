## Background

From Fleetwood Mac's 1977 masterpiece *Rumours*, "Dreams" stands as the album's only number-one single and remains the band's biggest commercial hit. Written by Stevie Nicks in about ten minutes while sitting at a grand piano in the Record Plant's empty studio, the song addressed her deteriorating relationship with Lindsey Buckingham.

The famously turbulent recording sessions for *Rumours* saw all five band members dealing with romantic dissolution—Nicks and Buckingham were separating, as were John and Christine McVie. This emotional raw material infused the album with an authenticity that listeners immediately recognized.

## Why It's Good

"Dreams" succeeds through restraint and atmosphere. While the album contains more technically ambitious tracks, this song's power lies in what it holds back. Nicks' vocals float above Mick Fleetwood's hypnotic drumbeat, creating a trance-like quality that mirrors the disorientation of heartbreak.

The song's genius lies in its emotional maturity. Rather than anger or recrimination, Nicks expresses a kind of weary wisdom about love's impermanence. The famous line about thunder only happening when it's raining captures the inevitability of storms in any relationship.

The production showcases the band's chemistry—Buckingham's guitar work, Christine McVie's keyboards, and Fleetwood's propulsive drums create a bed of sound that supports rather than overwhelms Nicks' ethereal vocals.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's enduring appeal stems from its acceptance of romantic endings without bitterness. Nicks manages to be both wounded and wise, acknowledging pain while refusing to be destroyed by it. The rain and thunder imagery transforms personal heartbreak into something almost mythological.

The repeated refrain becomes a kind of gentle warning, delivered with compassion rather than spite.
