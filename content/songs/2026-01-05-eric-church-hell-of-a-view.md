There's a moment—usually around forty, sometimes earlier if life's been generous with its lessons—when you stop regretting the hard parts and start being grateful for what they showed you. Eric Church wrote a song about that moment.

"Hell of a View" came out on *Heart & Soul* in 2021, during the pandemic lockdown when everyone had a little too much time to think about where they'd been and where they were going. Church spent that time writing, and what came out wasn't the rebel country of his earlier work. It was something more seasoned. More honest.

The song doesn't pretend life is easy. It doesn't promise that everything happens for a reason. It just says: look at where you're standing. Look at what you can see from here. Was the climb worth it?

"This ain't for everybody, to go out on a limb." No, it isn't. The easy path is easy for a reason. But Church isn't interested in the easy path. He's interested in the people who chose the harder one and lived to tell about it.

The production walks that line Church has always walked—country enough to play on Nashville radio, rock enough to fill an arena. Acoustic guitars grounding the verses, electric lifting the chorus. His voice carrying that particular weathered quality that only comes from actually living the songs you sing.

"I was born to run, I was born to dream." That's not bragging. That's inventory. Taking stock of who you are and refusing to apologize for it, even when being that person costs you something.

The chorus hits like a revelation: "It's a hell of a view." Not despite the struggle. Because of it. The view from the easy path doesn't look like much. You have to earn the panorama.

Some songs are about surviving. This one's about looking back from the other side and realizing it was all part of getting here.

Wherever here is.
