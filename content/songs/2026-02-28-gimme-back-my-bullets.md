The bullets aren't ammunition. They're the little black dots Billboard used to print next to songs moving up the charts. Ronnie Van Zant wanted his back, and he wasn't asking politely.

By 1976, Lynyrd Skynyrd had a problem. Their first few albums had made them Southern rock royalty—"Free Bird," "Sweet Home Alabama," songs that still play at every tailgate and dive bar south of the Mason-Dixon. But the hits had slowed. The industry wanted them to sound more like the hits they'd already had. Less like themselves.

This song was Van Zant's response: a middle finger wrapped in three minutes of driving rock. Give me back my bullets. Give me the ammunition to fight my way back. But do it on my terms, or don't bother.

The guitars punch like they mean it. Allen Collins and Gary Rossington lock into a groove that feels like a car with the accelerator pinned. Van Zant's vocal is pure defiance—not screaming, just absolutely certain that he's right and the suits are wrong.

There's something beautiful about a band demanding commercial success on their own terms. Most artists either sell out or pretend they don't care about sales. Skynyrd said: we want the hits, but we won't become something we're not to get them. That's harder to do than it sounds.

They got their bullets back. Not with this album—it underperformed—but in the end, they outlasted everyone who told them to compromise. Some wars are won by refusing to stop.
