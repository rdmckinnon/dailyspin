There's a thing that happens when great singers cover great songs. Usually, they add. They layer. They show you what they can do. Chris Cornell did the opposite. He stripped everything away until there was nothing left but his voice, an acoustic guitar, and words about losing someone you can't replace.

Prince wrote this song in 1985 for The Family, a side project nobody remembers. Sinéad O'Connor made it a global phenomenon in 1990, her tear rolling down her face in that iconic video. Those versions had production, arrangement, the safety net of a full band surrounding the vulnerability. Cornell took away the net.

He recorded this for *Carry On*, a 2007 solo album that got lost between his Audioslave years and the Soundgarden reunion. It's the kind of cover that slips past you if you're not paying attention—just another track on another album. But if you stop and listen, it destroys you.

His voice. That impossible four-octave voice that could shake stadiums with Soundgarden. Here, he uses it like a wound. When he reaches for the high notes, you hear him straining—not because he can't reach them, but because the emotion demands that strain. The roughness is the point.

The lyrics chronicle the aftermath of loss—trying to distract yourself, finding that nothing works, admitting that the person who left took something irreplaceable with them. Cornell lived inside those words. You can hear it.

Ten years after he recorded this, he was gone. The voice that made this version possible, silent. Listen to it now and try not to hear the goodbye hiding in the hello.

Some covers compete with the original. This one just tells the truth.
