## Background

From Pink Floyd's 1975 masterpiece *Wish You Were Here*, "Have a Cigar" offers a withering portrayal of music industry executives. The song features guest vocals from folk artist Roy Harper, who happened to be recording in an adjacent studio when neither Roger Waters nor David Gilmour felt capable of delivering the track's sneering tone effectively.

The lyrics compile actual phrases and attitudes the band encountered from record company representatives—people who saw artists as products and success as the only metric that mattered. The famous line asking which one is Pink referenced real confusion from executives who didn't know the band members' names.

## Why It's Good

"Have a Cigar" succeeds through its perfect marriage of biting satire and muscular rock performance. Harper's vocals drip with the oily insincerity of a label executive making promises he has no intention of keeping. The band's playing is tight and aggressive, matching the song's acidic tone.

The song's genius lies in its specificity. Rather than vague complaints about "the industry," Floyd presents a detailed portrait of exploitation dressed up as opportunity. The executive's enthusiasm is revealed as purely transactional—he doesn't care about art, only about riding "the gravy train."

The production features Gilmour's snarling guitar and Richard Wright's swirling keyboards, creating a sound that's simultaneously commercial and subversive. The track rocks hard enough for radio while delivering a message that undermines the very system that would broadcast it.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's enduring relevance comes from its portrait of creative exploitation that remains accurate decades later. Every musician who's sat through a meeting with someone who sees them as a commodity recognizes the type Floyd lampoons.

The track's climax features some of rock's most cynical observations about the gap between industry flattery and industry reality.
