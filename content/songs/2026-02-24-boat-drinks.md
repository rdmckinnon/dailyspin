It's February. Or maybe January. Or that stretch of March that feels like February's revenge. The snow is gray. Your coat smells like wet dog. The sun sets at 4:30 PM. And somewhere inside you, a voice starts chanting: "I gotta go where it's warm."

Jimmy Buffett heard that voice. He built a career on it.

"Boat Drinks" dropped in 1979 on *Volcano*, and it's basically a manifesto for everyone who's ever fantasized about abandoning their responsibilities for a beach chair and something with rum in it. The song isn't subtle about this. "This morning I shot six holes in my freezer. I think I got cabin fever."

Buffett understood something important: escapism isn't laziness. It's survival. The nine-to-five, the commute, the endless winter—these things will kill you slowly if you don't have something to look forward to. A trip. A beach. Even just the idea of a beach. The fantasy keeps you alive until you can make it real.

The steel drums hit and suddenly you're not in traffic anymore. You're somewhere the locals don't wear shoes and nobody asks about your quarterly reports. The band sounds loose, like they recorded this between margaritas. Maybe they did. That's the point.

"Visitors scored on the home rink. Everything seems to be wrong." Buffett's listing grievances—bad weather, losing hockey games, the general malaise of northern existence—but he's not complaining. He's building a case. An escape plan. Every cold detail makes the warm destination more necessary.

The Parrotheads turned this into a religion. Grass skirts and coconut bras at concerts in Ohio. They got it. They understood that sometimes you need to build your own tropics wherever you are.

Buffett's gone now. But the philosophy survives: when life gives you winter, book a flight.

Or at least close your eyes and pretend.
