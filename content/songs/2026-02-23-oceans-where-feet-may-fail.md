"Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders."

That's the line people tattoo on their arms. The line they pray when they don't know what else to pray. The line that sounds like surrender and sounds like courage and sounds like the edge of something you can't take back.

Hillsong United released "Oceans" on *Zion* in 2013, and it became inescapable in churches worldwide. Nine minutes long, which feels like a commitment. You don't play this song lightly. You play it when you mean it.

The song references Peter stepping out of the boat to walk on water toward Jesus. You know the story: he does fine until he looks down, sees the waves, gets scared, starts sinking. The point isn't that he failed. The point is that he got out of the boat in the first place.

That's what the song's about. Getting out of the boat. Stepping where your feet may fail. Trusting that something will catch you even when logic says you'll drown.

The arrangement starts sparse—just voice and piano, intimate as a whispered prayer. Then it builds. Slowly, deliberately. Each instrument entering like another step into deeper water. By the time the bridge hits, it's a full swell, an ocean of sound that matches the lyric's emotional weight.

Joel Houston and Matt Crocker wrote something that feels genuinely risky. "Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander." That's not a safe prayer. That's asking for trouble. That's requesting exactly the kind of situation where you'd have no choice but to rely on faith because there's nothing else to hold onto.

The production creates space. Big, reverberant space that sounds like being alone in a cathedral or lost at sea. It mirrors the vulnerability of the lyrics—vast and terrifying and somehow beautiful.

Whether you share the theology or not, the feeling is universal. Everyone has stood at the edge of something and wondered if they should jump. Everyone has chosen between the safety of the boat and the possibility of the water.

Some songs are about certainty. This one's about choosing to move forward without any.
