description: "Roland Orzabal made an album without Curt Smith and stripped everything back to what matters. This is the title track."
---

Tears For Fears split up after *The Seeds of Love*. Everyone knew. Roland and Curt couldn't be in the same room anymore. The band that made "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" and "Shout" was done.

Except Roland kept going. He kept the name—because legally he could, and emotionally he had to—and in 1993 he released *Elemental*. It was a quieter record than people expected. No massive synth anthems, no stadium-ready choruses. Just a man trying to figure out what remained after you stripped everything away.

The title track is exactly what it claims to be: a meditation on fundamental forces. Earth, air, fire, water. Love, fear, hope, despair. The things that exist whether or not your band is together. The things that matter when the contracts and the royalties and the lawsuits stop mattering.

Orzabal's voice on this track carries years of exhaustion. Not defeated—working through it. The production gives him space to breathe. There are no walls of sound here, just textures that accumulate slowly, like silt building up at the bottom of a river.

Most bands would have chased the old hits. Tried to recapture "Mad World" or "Head Over Heels." Roland went the other direction. He made something that sounded nothing like classic Tears For Fears, and everything like where he was in his life.

Some songs try to be everything. This one tries to find the core.
