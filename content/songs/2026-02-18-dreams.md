Ten minutes. That's how long it took Stevie Nicks to write this song. She was sitting alone in the Record Plant's empty studio, at Sly Stone's grand piano, while the rest of Fleetwood Mac was off doing whatever people did between takes in 1977. And in ten minutes, she wrote the only number-one hit the band would ever have.

Here's the part that kills me: Lindsey Buckingham had to play guitar on this. His ex-girlfriend wrote a song about how he was going to regret losing her, and then he had to sit in the studio and make it sound good. That's the whole *Rumours* story in miniature—five people who were destroying each other, professionally obligated to help each other be brilliant.

The drums are the thing. Mick Fleetwood found this hypnotic, almost tribal pattern that sounds like a heartbeat slowing down. Like someone falling asleep. Like someone letting go. Everything else floats on top of it—Stevie's voice, the bass, Lindsey's guitar lines—but those drums are the foundation. The pulse of a relationship flatlining in slow motion.

"Thunder only happens when it's raining." It's such a simple observation. Weather does what weather does. And people do what people do. You can't have the storm without the conditions that created it. You can't be surprised when things fall apart if you've been watching them fall apart for months.

What makes this song devastating isn't anger. It's acceptance. Stevie isn't yelling at Lindsey. She isn't begging him to come back. She's just telling him the truth: you'll think of me when you're lonely. Players only love you when they're playing. This is how it ends.

And then she had to watch him across the studio for months afterward, both of them pretending they could handle it.

Some breakup songs want revenge. This one just wants you to understand.
