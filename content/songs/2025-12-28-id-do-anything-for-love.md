## Background

Written by Jim Steinman as the lead single from *Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell*, "I'd Do Anything for Love" represents the songwriter's most grandiose creation—which is saying something. The twelve-minute album version deploys full orchestra, operatic vocal arrangements, and the kind of dramatic excess that Steinman turned into an art form.

The song became Meat Loaf's biggest hit, reaching number one in 28 countries and winning a Grammy. Its success proved that in 1993, when grunge dominated, audiences still craved theatrical rock spectacle.

## Why It's Good

"I'd Do Anything for Love" succeeds through its total commitment to excess. Steinman and Meat Loaf don't hedge—they create something deliberately overwrought, trusting that emotional sincerity can redeem any amount of bombast. The arrangement builds and builds, adding elements until it achieves genuine lift.

The song's genius lies in its mysterious refrain. The "that" he won't do remains unexplained until careful listening reveals the answers embedded in the lyrics. This ambiguity sparked endless speculation and kept listeners engaged across multiple plays.

The production represents studio maximalism at its most successful. Every element serves the emotional arc, building from piano ballad intimacy to full orchestral explosion.

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics catalog extreme romantic gestures—promises of devotion so complete they border on terrifying. Steinman writes love as total surrender, then creates boundaries that preserve identity.

The callback structure, where "that" refers to specific betrayals mentioned in the female verses, rewards attentive listening.
