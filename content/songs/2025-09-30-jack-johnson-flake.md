We all know someone like this. The person who says "maybe" when they mean "no." The one who commits to plans they have no intention of keeping. The one who leaves you waiting, again, wondering why you're surprised.

Jack Johnson wrote them a song. And somehow, it doesn't sound bitter.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - someone who always let you down, or a time when you were the flake]

"Flake" comes from *Brushfire Fairytales*, Johnson's 2001 debut that soundtracked every beach bonfire and dorm room hangout for the next decade. The man was a professional surfer before he picked up a guitar, and you can hear the water in everything he does—that patient, rhythmic quality of someone who's spent a lot of time waiting for waves.

The fingerpicking pattern is hypnotic. Simple enough that you could learn it in an afternoon, sophisticated enough that it keeps pulling you back in. Johnson's voice rides on top, conversational and warm, like he's telling you about his day rather than performing.

"It seems to me that 'maybe' pretty much always means 'no.'" That's the line. That's the whole truth of dealing with unreliable people, delivered without malice. Just observation. Just acceptance.

There's a Buddhist quality to Johnson's frustration. He's annoyed, sure. But he's not surprised. He's not demanding that people change. He's just... noting. This is how it is. This is how they are. The waves come when they come.

The production stays out of the way—acoustic guitar, gentle percussion, maybe some bass lurking in the background. No studio tricks. No overwrought arrangements. Just a guy and a song and a truth that anyone who's ever waited for someone can understand.

"I know she loves the sunrise, no longer sees it with her sleeping eyes." That's not accusation. That's elegy. He's mourning who she was, or who he thought she was, before the flakiness became the defining feature.

Some songs rage against unreliability. This one just shrugs.

Sometimes a shrug is the only honest response.
