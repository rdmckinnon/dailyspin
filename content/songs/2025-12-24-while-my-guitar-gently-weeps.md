## Background

At George Harrison's 2004 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, an all-star band assembled to perform "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, and Harrison's son Dhani formed the core group. Prince was there too, seemingly in a supporting role.

Then came the guitar solo. What happened next became one of rock's most celebrated moments. Prince stepped forward and delivered a performance so extraordinary that it transcended tribute, becoming its own legend. The quiet superstar had reminded everyone exactly who he was.

## Why It's Good

This performance succeeds because Prince understood the assignment—and then exceeded it spectacularly. The first minutes function as respectful tribute, the band honoring Harrison's legacy. Then Prince enters with a solo that honors the original while asserting his own genius.

The performance's genius lies in its arc. Prince builds from tasteful phrases to increasingly adventurous territory, finally erupting into full shredding while falling backward into the crowd. It's theatrical, virtuosic, and utterly Prince.

The other musicians' reactions tell the story. Tom Petty's grin, Dhani Harrison's amazement—they're watching something unprecedented. Prince made a tribute into a coronation.

## Standout Lyrics

While Harrison's lyrics remain intact, this performance is about the guitar speaking. Every bend, every sustained note, every run up the fretboard carries emotional weight. Prince's instrument genuinely weeps, then screams, then celebrates.

The final image—Prince disappearing into the crowd, his guitar still ringing—has become iconic.
