## Background

Chris Tomlin's "Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)" represents one of the most successful contemporary adaptations of a traditional hymn. Released in 2006 on his album *See the Morning*, Tomlin took John Newton's 1772 masterpiece and added new verses by Louie Giglio, creating a bridge between historical Christian worship and modern praise music.

The additional "My chains are gone" chorus transforms the already powerful message of Amazing Grace into a declaration of freedom and liberation. Tomlin's version has become a staple in contemporary worship services worldwide, introducing the timeless hymn to new generations while honoring its sacred origins.

## Why It's Good

Tomlin's arrangement respects the hymn's reverent foundation while infusing it with contemporary energy. His warm, accessible vocal style makes the profound theological concepts approachable without diminishing their weight. The production builds thoughtfully from intimate verses to soaring choruses, creating space for both personal reflection and corporate worship.

The genius lies in how the new verses complement rather than compete with Newton's original text. The "chains are gone" refrain serves as both musical hook and theological statement, emphasizing the transformative power of grace in terms that resonate with modern listeners.

{{< lyrics-callout style="centered" artist="Chris Tomlin" song="Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)" >}}
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but now I'm found  
Was blind, but now I see

The acoustic guitar-driven arrangement creates intimacy while the full band arrangement provides the dynamic range necessary for large worship gatherings.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's power comes from its seamless blend of Newton's timeless words with contemporary declarations of spiritual freedom.

My chains are gone  
I've been set free  
My God, my Savior has ransomed me  
And like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love, Amazing Grace
