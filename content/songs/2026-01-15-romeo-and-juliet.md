description: "Mark Knopfler's voice breaks on the word 'lovestruck.' That's the whole review."
---

The Shakespeare version ends with two dead teenagers. This version is worse. Nobody dies. She just moves on, and he stays exactly where she left him, frozen in the moment before everything fell apart.

Knopfler wrote this about a real relationship—reportedly with Holly Vincent of Holly and the Italians. He was the street singer serenading her window. She was the girl who eventually had somewhere else to be. The song watches her walk away and keeps replaying the memory of when she didn't.

The fingerpicking is almost too pretty. Three notes cascading down like water, like time passing, like the way you can't stop remembering someone even when you try. Knopfler doesn't have the classically beautiful voice. It's weathered, conversational, slightly rough. That roughness makes the vulnerability land harder. When he talks about their song coming on the radio, you believe he's been sitting in a parked car, unable to turn it off or drive away.

This isn't a tragedy of circumstance. There's no family feud, no poison, no daggers. Just two people who wanted different things, and one of them figured it out first. The one who didn't is stuck writing songs about it, trying to turn heartbreak into something that makes sense.

The real knife in this song isn't the breakup. It's the line about how she can fall for chains of silver but she can't fall for him. Some people become beautiful memories. Some people become songs. He became a song she doesn't listen to anymore.

Some love stories end. Some just stop.
