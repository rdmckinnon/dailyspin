Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

You know it. The guy at the end of the bar knows it. Your grandmother knows it. Soccer hooligans in Manchester and football crowds in Alabama know it. That riff has become a universal language, the musical equivalent of "Hello" in every country on the planet.

Here's the trick—it's not even a bass. Jack White played it on a guitar through a pitch shifter, dropping it an octave. The White Stripes didn't have a bass player. They didn't need one. They didn't need much of anything except Jack's vision and Meg's drumming, which sounds like someone kicking a door down in slow motion.

"Seven Nation Army" comes from *Elephant*, released in 2003. The title came from Jack's childhood mispronunciation of "Salvation Army," which is exactly the kind of origin story you'd expect from a song this stripped down and elemental. Everything about it sounds like it came from some primordial rock and roll swamp.

The minimalism is the point. Most bands would have buried that riff under layers of production, added harmonies, complicated the arrangement. Jack and Meg let it breathe. Let it stomp. Let it become the only thing you hear when you close your eyes.

"I'm gonna fight 'em off." Fight who? Doesn't matter. The specifics aren't the point. The feeling is the point. That snarling defiance, that absolutely unearned confidence that you—yes, you—can take on the entire world and win.

The song structure is almost insultingly simple. Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, out. Meg's drums never deviate from their primal march. And somehow, in that simplicity, they created something that will outlive us all.

The riff will be playing at sporting events long after anyone remembers who The White Stripes were. That's not sad. That's the dream. That's the music separating from the musicians and becoming something that belongs to everyone.

Seven notes. Seven nation army. Sometimes less really is everything.
