## Background

From Mötley Crüe's 1989 album *Dr. Feelgood*, "Kickstart My Heart" draws directly from bassist Nikki Sixx's 1987 heroin overdose, during which his heart stopped and paramedics used adrenaline injection to revive him. The song transforms trauma into celebration—life itself as the ultimate rush.

The track became one of hair metal's definitive anthems, its driving energy perfect for car commercials, sports events, and anywhere else that demands instant adrenaline. The motorcycle engine sounds in the intro and outro cement its association with speed and danger.

## Why It's Good

"Kickstart My Heart" succeeds through pure momentum. From the opening engine rev to the final note, the song never lets up. The riff drives relentlessly, Vince Neil's vocals strain with genuine exhilaration, and the production captures the band at their tightest.

The song's genius lies in its authenticity beneath the flash. Sixx really did die and come back—the rush he describes isn't metaphor but memory. This gives the celebration of life weight beyond typical party-rock sentiment.

The production showcases late-80s hard rock at its polished peak. Every guitar crunch, every drum hit lands with precision, creating a wall of sound that justifies the song's claims of overwhelming intensity.

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics channel the sensation of revival—the heart literally kickstarted, the body flooded with chemical energy. Sixx describes living hard because he knows how quickly life can stop.

The repeated demands to "kickstart my heart" work as both literal reference and metaphor for needing intensity to feel alive.
