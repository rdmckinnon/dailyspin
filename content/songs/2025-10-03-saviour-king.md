There's a moment in a Hillsong song—this one, most of them—where the band drops out and it's just thousands of voices singing in a stadium. No irony. No distance. Just belief, loud and unashamed.

You can roll your eyes at it. A lot of people do. But try standing in a room when it happens and not feeling *something*.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - a worship moment that hit you, or didn't, and why]

<!--more-->

Hillsong United came out of Sydney, Australia, and by the mid-2000s they'd become the dominant force in contemporary worship music. "Saviour King" is from *All of the Above*, released in 2007, and it's a perfect example of their formula: build slow, crescendo big, invite everyone to join in.

The formula works because it's designed to work. Marty Sampson and Mia Fieldes wrote this song knowing exactly how it would function in a service—the quiet moments for reflection, the explosive choruses for communal release. It's engineered for its purpose, and there's no shame in that. A hammer doesn't need to be subtle.

The lyrics aren't poetry. They're declaration. Statements of faith designed to be sung by people who believe them, or want to believe them, or are trying to figure out what they believe. The repetition isn't lazy—it's liturgical. Say it enough times and maybe it becomes true. Maybe that's the whole point.

The production is slick—too slick for some tastes. Electric guitars with the right amount of edge, drums that punch without threatening, keyboards that soar on cue. It sounds like a million dollars because it probably cost that much.

But here's the thing: cynicism only gets you so far. At some point you have to reckon with the fact that millions of people find genuine meaning in this music. They raise their hands. They close their eyes. They sing about a king who saves, and for those minutes, they feel saved.

That's not nothing.

Whether you believe in the theology or not, you have to respect the craft. And maybe, if you're honest, admit that the feeling they're chasing isn't so different from what everyone's chasing.

Something bigger than themselves.
