## Background

"Here Comes the Sun" emerged during the tense *Abbey Road* sessions in 1969, written by George Harrison as an expression of relief and renewal. Inspired by a walk in Eric Clapton's garden on a beautiful spring day, the song represented Harrison's escape from the business pressures and internal conflicts that were tearing The Beatles apart.

The track showcases Harrison's growth as a songwriter, featuring innovative acoustic guitar techniques and one of the most memorable melodies in The Beatles' catalog. It stands as one of the most universally beloved songs in popular music, offering hope and optimism during one of the band's most difficult periods.

## Why It's Good

Harrison's fingerpicked acoustic guitar creates a delicate foundation that perfectly mirrors the song's theme of gentle emergence from darkness. His vocal delivery is warm and reassuring, transforming simple observations about weather into profound statements about renewal and hope. The innovative use of the Moog synthesizer adds ethereal textures that enhance rather than overwhelm the organic elements.

The song's structure builds naturally from intimate verses to soaring choruses, creating the musical equivalent of sunrise. Paul McCartney's bass work and Ringo Starr's drumming provide subtle propulsion while maintaining the song's peaceful character. The production captures both intimacy and grandeur, making it equally effective in headphones and large venues.

Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Here comes the sun  
And I say  
It's all right

The innovative recording techniques, including the creative use of handclaps and unconventional time signatures, demonstrate The Beatles' continued musical evolution.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's power lies in its ability to find profound hope in simple natural imagery, transforming everyday observations into universal statements about resilience.

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter  
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
