---

The Beatles were falling apart. Lawyers everywhere. John and Paul barely speaking. Apple Corps hemorrhaging money. And George Harrison, the quiet one, the one who always got the short end of the songwriting stick, walked out of a meeting he didn't want to be in and into Eric Clapton's garden.

The sun was shining. Spring had finally arrived. He picked up an acoustic guitar and wrote this.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - a moment when the winter finally broke, literally or otherwise]

"Here Comes the Sun" is the sound of relief. Not joy, exactly—that's too simple. Relief. The exhale after holding your breath for months. The first warm day after a winter that felt like it would never end.

"Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter." Harrison wasn't being poetic. He was being literal. The business nightmare of The Beatles' final years felt exactly like that—endless gray, no light anywhere, everyone frozen in their positions.

The acoustic guitar part is deceptively complex. That fingerpicking pattern, the way it dances around the beat, the syncopation that makes it feel like sunlight through leaves. Harrison worked out every note, every pause, every breath. It sounds effortless because he made it effortless.

The Moog synthesizer enters like warmth itself, adding colors that didn't exist in pop music before. The time signature shifts—from 4/4 to 7/8 to 4/4 and back—but you don't notice unless you're counting. It just feels like weather changing, like clouds moving.

"Sun, sun, sun, here it comes." The simplest words imaginable, repeated like a mantra, like someone convincing themselves it's true.

And here's what gets me: Harrison wrote this while everything was ending. He knew The Beatles were done. He knew the dream was over. And still, he looked at the sun and said, "It's all right."

That's not denial. That's acceptance. That's understanding that even endings have mornings after.

The ice is slowly melting. It always does.

Eventually.
