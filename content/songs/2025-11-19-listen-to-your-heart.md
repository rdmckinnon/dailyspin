## Background

Released in 1988 as part of the *Look Sharp!* album, "Listen to Your Heart" became one of Roxette's most successful hits. The song showcases Marie Fredriksson's incredible vocal range and emotional delivery, paired with Per Gessle's sharp songwriting. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, cementing the Swedish duo's status as global superstars.

The track is a quintessential power ballad, featuring a dramatic piano intro, soaring guitars, and a chorus that demands to be sung along to. It captures the universal struggle of choosing between logic and emotion in relationships.

## Why It's Good

"Listen to Your Heart" is a masterclass in building tension and release. The verses are intimate and restrained, allowing the story to unfold, while the chorus explodes with passion and energy. The production is polished yet retains a raw emotional core, largely thanks to Fredriksson's powerhouse performance.

It's a song that resonates because it speaks to a fundamental human experience: the confusion of love and the need to trust one's inner voice when things get complicated.

{{< lyrics-callout style="centered" artist="Roxette" song="Listen to Your Heart" >}}
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics are simple yet profound, cutting straight to the heart of the matter. They offer advice that feels both personal and universal.

{{< lyrics-callout style="inline" >}}
And there are voices
That want to be heard
So much to mention
But you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind
