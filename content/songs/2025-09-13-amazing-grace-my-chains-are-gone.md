John Newton spent his early life trafficking human beings. Then one night in 1748, a storm nearly killed him, and he decided to reconsider his choices. He wrote "Amazing Grace" in 1772. It's been sung at every funeral, wedding, and church service since.

Chris Tomlin added a chorus in 2006. "My chains are gone, I've been set free."

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - a moment of grace, earned or unearned, that changed something]

Here's the thing about "Amazing Grace"—it's become so ubiquitous that we've stopped hearing it. It's wallpaper. Background noise for moments that are supposed to feel sacred. Tomlin's addition cuts through that numbness.

"My chains are gone." The chains Newton helped put on other people. The chains he felt on himself. The chains we all drag around, whatever form they take. The chorus doesn't add new theology. It just makes the old theology impossible to ignore.

The arrangement is pure contemporary worship—piano, building acoustic guitar, eventually a full band swell that sounds like exactly what it is: a room full of people who need to believe in something. The cynic in you wants to roll your eyes. But then you're standing in a room full of people singing "My God, my Savior has ransomed me," and something happens that's harder to dismiss than you'd like.

The original lyrics survive intact. "That saved a wretch like me." Newton meant that literally. He knew what he'd done. The song isn't asking for forgiveness—it's marveling that forgiveness is possible at all.

Whether you believe in the specific God being invoked here is beside the point. The song is about transformation. About looking at who you were and realizing you don't have to stay that person. About the terrifying and beautiful possibility that chains can break.

"Like a flood His mercy rains." Notice the pun—rains and reigns. Tomlin's not reinventing the wheel here. He's just polishing it until you can see your reflection.

Two hundred and fifty years later, we're still singing a slave trader's apology. That's either profoundly hopeful or deeply unsettling.

Maybe both.
