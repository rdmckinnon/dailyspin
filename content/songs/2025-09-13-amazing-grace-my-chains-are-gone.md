## Background

Chris Tomlin's 2006 arrangement of "Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)" represents a masterclass in honoring tradition while creating something entirely fresh. Building on John Newton's 1772 hymn, Tomlin added new verses written by Louie Giglio that amplify the original's themes of redemption and freedom. The song became a cornerstone of modern worship music.

Recorded for Tomlin's album *See the Morning*, this version maintains the hymn's theological depth while incorporating contemporary production elements that make it accessible to modern congregations. The arrangement was specifically crafted to allow both intimate reflection and corporate worship.

## Why It's Good

What makes this arrangement exceptional is its reverent innovation. Tomlin doesn't alter Newton's original verses but enhances them with complementary lyrics that expand on the grace narrative. The musical arrangement builds organically, starting with simple acoustic guitar and building to full orchestration without overwhelming the message.

The song's genius lies in its bridge - "My chains are gone, I've been set free" - which transforms the abstract concept of grace into tangible imagery of liberation. This addition gives congregations a powerful declaration to sing together.

{{< lyrics-callout style="centered" artist="Chris Tomlin" song="Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)" >}}
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but now I'm found  
Was blind, but now I see

The production perfectly balances reverence with contemporary sensibilities, using modern instruments and arrangements while preserving the hymn's timeless character.

## Standout Lyrics

The power of this version lies in how the new lyrics complement and amplify Newton's original message of transformation and redemption.

My chains are gone  
I've been set free  
My God, my Savior has ransomed me  
And like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love, Amazing Grace
