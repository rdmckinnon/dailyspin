## Background

The title track from Tears For Fears' 1993 album *Elemental* marked Roland Orzabal's first album without founding member Curt Smith. The track exemplifies the album's introspective direction, stripping away some of the duo's 80s polish in favor of more organic, atmospheric arrangements.

The song addresses fundamental human experiences and emotions—the elemental forces referenced in the title. Orzabal's songwriting had matured significantly since the band's early synth-pop days, embracing complexity and ambiguity.

## Why It's Good

"Elemental" succeeds through its layers and patience. The track builds gradually, adding textures and revealing new dimensions on repeated listens. Orzabal's voice carries both strength and vulnerability, perfectly suited to lyrics exploring basic human nature.

The song's genius lies in its title concept—reducing experience to elemental components. By focusing on fundamental forces (earth, air, fire, water; love, fear, hope, despair), Orzabal creates something both specific and universal.

The production creates space and atmosphere without the bombast of earlier Tears For Fears recordings. It's a more mature sound that rewards careful listening.

## Standout Lyrics

The lyrics explore what makes us essentially human—the basic building blocks of experience and emotion. Orzabal doesn't provide easy answers but invites reflection on what truly matters beneath surface concerns.

The elemental imagery connects personal experience to universal forces, suggesting we're all made of the same fundamental stuff.
