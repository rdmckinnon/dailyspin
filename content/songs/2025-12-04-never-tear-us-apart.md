## Background

From INXS's blockbuster 1987 album *Kick*, "Never Tear Us Apart" showcased a more cinematic side of the Australian band. Written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence, the song emerged from the same sessions that produced "Need You Tonight" and "New Sensation," yet stands apart for its orchestral ambition and emotional nakedness.

The track features a 60-piece orchestra arranged by producer Chris Thomas, giving the song a sweeping grandeur unusual for an era dominated by synthesizers and drum machines. Hutchence's vocal performance ranks among his finest—intimate in the verses, soaring in the chorus, capturing both vulnerability and fierce determination.

## Why It's Good

"Never Tear Us Apart" succeeds through its dynamic range and emotional commitment. The song builds from hushed, almost whispered verses to explosive declarations, mirroring the overwhelming nature of the love it describes. The orchestral arrangement never overwhelms—it amplifies the emotion without burying the band's rock foundation.

The song's genius lies in Hutchence's performance. He inhabits the lyrics completely, conveying both the fear of loss and the certainty of connection. The way his voice breaks slightly on certain phrases adds humanity to what could have been mere bombast.

The production balances 1980s polish with timeless songcraft. The string section provides classical weight while the rhythm section keeps the track grounded in contemporary rock. It's a pop song with the emotional scope of an opera aria.

## Standout Lyrics

The song's power comes from its blend of cosmic imagery and intimate declaration. The lyrics speak of fate and destiny while remaining grounded in the specific experience of two people who have found each other against the odds.

Hutchence delivers each line with the conviction of someone who has staked everything on love's permanence, transforming a declaration into a vow.
