description: "An Irish folk singer turns a colonial explorer into a metaphor for everyone who ever left home."
---

The first time you leave home, really leave—not for a weekend, not for college, but *leave*—you understand something. The world is round. There's no edge to fall off. Just endless horizon in every direction, and you somewhere in the middle of it, small and terrified and finally free.

Mary Black understood that. She sang about Columbus, but she was singing about all of us.

[YOUR MEMORY HERE - the moment you left somewhere for somewhere else, not knowing if you'd return]

"Columbus" wasn't written by an Irish person—Charlie Dore and Julian Littman, both English—but Mary Black claimed it completely on her 1989 album *No Frontiers*. She took someone else's words and made them sound like they'd been living in her chest for years.

The production is deliberately sparse. Acoustic guitar. Subtle strings. Mary's voice, which could fill a cathedral but chooses instead to sit right next to your ear and tell you a story. The restraint is the whole thing. Another singer would have pushed harder on the emotion. Black just... presents it. Lets you do the work.

"Dreaming of Columbus, with your maps and your beautiful charts." The song uses the explorer as metaphor, and it works because everyone dreams of somewhere else. Everyone has a map to a place they haven't been. Everyone wonders what's past the horizon they can see.

The Irish understand this better than most. Generations of emigration. Coffin ships and Ellis Island and letters home that took months to arrive. Leaving is built into the cultural DNA. Black taps into something ancestral here, even singing about an Italian explorer funded by Spanish royalty.

"And the world is round." She repeats it like a revelation, like someone who's just realized the implications. The world is round, which means there's no edge. Which means you can keep going. Which means the only limits are the ones you carry with you.

The melody aches in that particular Irish way—sad but not defeated, mournful but still moving forward. This is music for airports and bus stations and standing on docks watching ships leave.

Some songs are about arriving. This one's about the courage it takes to depart.
